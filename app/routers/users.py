# Added async to all route functions for consistency with FastAPI best practices.
# Changed prefix to /api/users.
# Removed router-level dependency, applied get_current_active_user specifically to /me routes.
# Kept existing / and /{user_id} routes but noted they need proper auth.
# Implemented PUT /me for profile updates with email/username collision checks.
# Implemented PUT /me/password using crud.update_password, returns 204.
# Added placeholder GET and PUT for /me/preferences with notes about User model dependency.
# Imported Dict, Any, Response, status.
# `verify_password` import might be redundant if `crud.update_password` handles it all, which it does.
# For PUT /me/preferences, if `models.User.preferences` is a SQLAlchemy `JSON` type,
# direct assignment `current_user.preferences = preferences` and `db.commit()` should work.
# The placeholder returns the updated preferences dictionary.
# Added status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND for read_user_by_id.
# Added status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST for email/username collision in PUT /me.
# Added status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT for PUT /me/password.
# The preferences endpoints currently raise 501 if 'preferences' attribute is not on User model,
# or attempt a mock update if it is. This will need alignment with actual User model structure.
# If `User.preferences` is added as `Column(JSONB)` or `Column(JSON)`, then `current_user.preferences = preferences`
# followed by `db.commit()` is the way to update it. The response would then be `current_user.preferences`.
# Added `type: ignore` for `current_user.preferences = preferences` to bypass potential static type checking errors
# if the `preferences` attribute isn't formally defined on the `models.User` type hint used by the linters/type checkers.
# The placeholder for preferences GET now tries to parse if it's a string, or return if dict.
# The placeholder for preferences PUT now attempts to set and then return the value, assuming it's a dict-like field.
# It's important that if `preferences` is a JSON string field in the DB, UserUpdate schema should accept Dict and crud.update_user
# should handle serializing it to JSON string before saving, or the model should use SQLAlchemy's JSON type.
# For now, the preference routes are illustrative of how they *could* work if the model supported it.
# The crud.update_password already handles password verification, so no need to call verify_password in the router.
# The current implementation of PUT /me/preferences directly modifies the current_user object and commits.
# This is a common pattern but could also be encapsulated in a specific crud function like `crud.update_user_preferences`.
# The example dependencies on read_users_list and read_user_by_id are illustrative of how one might protect them.
# A real app would need more robust role-based access control (RBAC).
# Changed `user_update: schemas.UserUpdate` in `update_current_user_me` to match the actual schema name.
# The check for email/username collision in `update_current_user_me` is important.
# The return from `crud.update_password` is correctly checked.
# `Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)` is the correct way to return no content.
# Final review of imports and dependencies. Looks fine.
# The preferences routes are clearly marked as placeholders and dependent on model changes.
# The core /me routes are implemented as per requirements.
# The general user list and user detail are kept but marked as needing further auth.
# The prefix `/api/users` is set.
# Tags are set.
# HTTPExceptions are used for errors.
# Response models are used.
# Status codes are specified.
# All looks good for this part.
